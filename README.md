Hello! I needed that kind of plugin and I couldn't see similar and easy to use one. This plugin runs a command when a player complete an advancement that you defined.

Plugin is very simple it doesnt has any optimization problems.

I will use it to create a rank system like survival experity and players will unlock skills with it. I suggest to combine it with skripts. It is really useful !

There are very funny advancement packs on the internet I strongly recommend to think about adding them into your server.

Here is a strong example https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/blazeandcave-s-advancements-pack-1-12/ Or https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/platys-advancement-and-recipe-pack I really liked it :)

You can configure the outputs however you want. Plugin is extremely configurable!

and if you need any support, I am avaible on discord: !OnwexryS#0675
